# Canadian Natural Gas-Pipeline Throughput and Capacity Data Visualization Project

Data Visualization project in Power BI, including exploring and shaping data with Python (pandas, glob, os, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib) libraries.

### 1. [View a snapshot of the visualization here](https://github.com/IjeomaOdoko/Natural-Gas-Pipeline-Report/blob/master/Gas%20pipeline%20throughput%20and%20capacity%20reportf%20(1).pdf)

### 2. Explore the Power BI visualization: 

Download the datasets from the Open Canada Website in two separate folders. 
Group A for only the natural gas pipelines
    NGTL System pipeline 
    Canadian Mainline 
    Foothills system
    Alliance Pipeline
    BC Pipeline also known as Westcoast Transmission system
    Trans Quebec & Maritimes Pipeline

Group B for all the other pipelines

[Download Power BI pbix file](https://github.com/IjeomaOdoko/Airbnb-Quebec-Data-Visualization-project/blob/master/Inside%20AirBnB%20data%20-%20Quebec.pbix) to your local machine, and change connection to where you downloaded the excel file.

[Download the python script](https://github.com/IjeomaOdoko/Natural-Gas-Pipeline-Report/blob/master/Dataframe%20for%20gas%20Pipeline%20data%20(Python%20Script).txt) and run in the Power BI pbix file. Note: This a condensed script that covers only the Group A folder for natural gas pipelines.

### 3. Additional exploratory data analysis of oil and natural gas pipeline throughput and capacity using python.

[Run this python script](https://github.com/IjeomaOdoko/Natural-Gas-Pipeline-Report/blob/master/Pipeline%20throughput%20dataframe%20and%20charts%20using%20pandas.ipynb)
